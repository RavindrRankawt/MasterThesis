Abstract

Skin cancer classification poses significant challenges and opportunities for advancements
in healthcare technologies. This thesis explores the use of machine learning and deep
learning models, with a focus on skin cancer classification using mmWave data representations.
The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of various classification
models across different data representations and feature sets, with an emphasis on identifying
the most robust and accurate methods for classification.
This study commences with a collection of mm-Wave recordings, addressing the challenge
of limited availability. Despite its small size comprising 44 samples, detailed comprehensive
experimental setups using mmWave radar data in both frequency and time domains,
along with spectrogram image classification. The findings suggest that ensemble techniques,
notably Random Forest and Extra Trees classifiers, consistently exhibit strong
performance, showcasing high levels of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. These
models excel in handling complex, high-dimensional data, capturing intricate patterns
that simpler models like the Logistic Regression Model, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Ridge
Classifier fail to recognize. However, convolutional neural network (CNN) models used
for spectrogram image classification exhibited signs of overfitting, achieving perfect scores
on training and validation sets but questionable generalization capabilities.
The high performance of ensemble methods suggests significant potential for deployment
in classification tasks where reliable and accurate diagnostics are crucial. Nevertheless,
the tendency of deep learning models to overfit underscores the need for improved training
strategies and model validation to enhance their applicability and robustness.
In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates the promising capabilities of advanced machine
learning techniques in skin cancer classification through mmWave radar and spectrogram
data analysis. It lays the groundwork for future research that could extend these modelsâ€™
applicability, ensuring to contribute effectively to patient care.
